# ASECN: Autonomous Self-Evolving Cognitive Network

## Comprehensive System Overview

### System Model
ASECN is a modular, intelligent system designed to autonomously evolve by perceiving its environment, taking actions, and learning from experiences. The system is structured into interconnected modules, each responsible for a specific cognitive or operational function. Below is the high-level system model:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Environment] --> B[Perception Layer]
    B --> C[Memory Core]
    C --> D[Action Layer]
    D --> A
    C --> E[Evolver]
    E --> C
    D --> F[Treasury]
```

- **Environment**: The external world that ASECN interacts with.
- **Perception Layer**: Collects and processes data from the environment.
- **Memory Core**: Stores and retrieves knowledge for decision-making.
- **Action Layer**: Executes decisions and interacts with the environment.
- **Evolver**: Continuously improves the system through learning.
- **Treasury**: Manages resources and financial operations.

### System Architecture
The architecture of ASECN is designed to ensure scalability, modularity, and real-time processing. Each module operates independently but communicates through well-defined interfaces.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Boot Task] --> B[Perception Layer]
    B --> C[Memory Core]
    C --> D[Action Layer]
    D --> E[Treasury]
    C --> F[Evolver]
```

- **Boot Task**: Initializes the system and prepares modules for operation.
- **Perception Layer**: Handles data collection and preprocessing.
- **Memory Core**: Manages short-term and long-term memory.
- **Action Layer**: Plans and executes actions based on decisions.
- **Treasury**: Allocates resources and performs financial analysis.
- **Evolver**: Updates models and adapts the system to new challenges.


### Logic Flow

#### Perception Layer
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input Data] --> B[Data Preprocessing]
    B --> C[Feature Extraction]
    C --> D[Pattern Recognition]
    D --> E[Output to Memory Core]
```
- **Perception Layer**: Processes raw input data, extracts meaningful features, and identifies patterns to pass to the Memory Core.

#### Memory Core
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input from Perception Layer] --> B[Short-Term Memory]
    B --> C[Long-Term Memory]
    C --> D[Knowledge Retrieval]
    D --> E[Output to Action Layer]
```
- **Memory Core**: Stores data in short-term and long-term memory, retrieves knowledge, and provides it to the Action Layer.

#### Action Layer
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input from Memory Core] --> B[Decision Making]
    B --> C[Action Planning]
    C --> D[Action Execution]
    D --> E[Feedback to Memory Core]
```
- **Action Layer**: Makes decisions, plans actions, executes them, and provides feedback to the Memory Core for continuous improvement.

#### Evolver
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input from Memory Core] --> B[Learning Algorithm]
    B --> C[Model Update]
    C --> D[Output to Memory Core]
```
- **Evolver**: Uses learning algorithms to update models and improve the system's performance over time.

#### Treasury
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input from Action Layer] --> B[Financial Analysis]
    B --> C[Resource Allocation]
    C --> D[Output to Action Layer]
```
- **Treasury**: Analyzes financial data, allocates resources, and ensures the system operates within its constraints.
